    <p>
      The DOCTYPE Declaration in HTML is like a special message at the beginning
      of a web page that tells web browsers which version of HTML is used in
      that page. It's helps browsers understand how to show the web page
      correctly.
    </p>
    <p>DOCTYPE Declaration is written in the first line of HTML code.</p>
