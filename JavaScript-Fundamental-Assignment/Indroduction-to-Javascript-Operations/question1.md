 ## Role of operators in JavaScript:
 JavaScript operators are symbols that are used to perform operations on operands. They are crutial for doing operation on data or value. Operators in JavaScript have many roles.

 - **Preforming Operation:** JavaScript operators are required to performing any type of operation in JavaScript such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/) etc.
 ```
 let a = 5+5;
 console.log(a) //10
 ```

 - **Comparation:** JavaScript operators such as “>”, “<”, “===”, “==”, “!=” etc. used to compare two or multiple values. These operators help in decision making.
```
console.log(4>2); //false
```

 - **Assigning Values:** JavaScript operators like “=” is used to assign values to variables. 
 ```
 const userName = "Manik";
 ```

 - **Logical Operations:** Operators like && (logical AND), || (logical OR), and ! (logical NOT) are used for logical operations, which are essential for decision-making and control flow.
 ```
 console.log(5>4 && 4<1); //false
 ```

 - **Increment and Decrement:** Operators like ++ and -- are used for incrementing and decrementing values, respectively.
```
 let a = 2;
 console.log(++a); //3
```
In summary, operators are essential in programming because they provide the means to manipulate and interact with data. They enable you to perform a wide range of operations, make decisions, and control the flow of your programs.


## Why are they essential in programming?

**Data Manipulation:** Operators allow you to perform operations on data, enabling you to manipulate and transform values. This is crucial for performing mathematical calculations, string manipulations, and various other data transformations.

**Expressiveness:** Operators contribute to the expressiveness of programming languages. They provide concise and readable ways to express complex operations, making code more understandable and efficient.

**Decision-Making:** Many operators are used in conditional statements and decision-making processes. For example, comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, etc.) are essential for evaluating conditions and controlling the flow of a program.

**Variable Assignment:** The assignment operator (=) is fundamental for storing values in variables. This allows you to manage and keep track of data within your programs.
