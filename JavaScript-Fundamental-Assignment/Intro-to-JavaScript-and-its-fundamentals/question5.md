## Comments in JavaScript:

Comments are an integral part of effective programming, and JavaScript is no exception. Comments provide a way to explain the purpose of code segments, document important decisions, and enhance code readability. They serve as valuable annotations that improve the overall quality and maintainability of JavaScript programs.

### Significance of Comments in JavaScript

1. **Enhanced Code Readability:** Comments make code more understandable and self-explanatory, especially for complex sections or less intuitive logic.

2. **Improved Code Maintainability:** Comments facilitate future code modifications by providing context and explanations of previous decisions.

3. **Effective Documentation:** Comments can be used to document important program functionalities, design decisions, and usage guidelines.

4. **Collaboration and Teamwork:** Comments aid in collaboration among team members by providing clear explanations and promoting shared understanding.

### Example of single-line comments:
```javascript
let myName = "Manik Maity" //This is my name 
//This is a single-line comment
```

### Example of multi-line comment:
```javascript
let myCourse = "PW Skill's Full Stack Web Developmnet"
/*
I am doing PW Skill's full stack development.
I am learning JavaScript.
This is a multi-line comment.
*/
