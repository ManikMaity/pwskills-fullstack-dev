# Differences Between HTML and JavaScript

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and JavaScript are two fundamental building blocks of web development, each serving distinct purposes.

## HTML:

HTML provides the structural framework of a web page, defining its content and organization. It consists of tags and attributes that describe the various elements of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. HTML ensures that web pages are rendered correctly across different browsers and devices.

## JavaScript: 

JavaScript, on the other hand, is a scripting language that brings web pages to life. It enables developers to add interactivity, dynamic behavior, and user engagement to websites. JavaScript can manipulate HTML elements, respond to user actions, and communicate with servers to create rich and immersive web experiences.


## Key Differences:

| Feature | HTML | JavaScript |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | Define the structure and content of web pages | Add interactivity, dynamic behavior, and user engagement |
| Syntax | Tags and attributes | Scripting language with syntax similar to C and Java |
| Execution | Interpreted by the web browser | Interpreted by the web browser |
| Client-side or Server-side | Client-side | Primarily client-side, but can also be used server-side with Node.js |

## Examples of Usage:

* **HTML:** Creating website layouts, defining headings, paragraphs, images, links, and other content elements.
* **JavaScript:** Creating interactive forms, validating user inputs, displaying dynamic content based on user actions, handling animations and transitions, communicating with servers to fetch data, and building rich web applications like single-page applications (SPAs).
