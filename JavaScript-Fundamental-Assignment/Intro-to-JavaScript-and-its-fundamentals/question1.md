* **Communicate with Servers:** JavaScript can send and receive data from servers, enabling real-time updates and data-driven applications.
* **Build Single-Page Applications (SPAs):** JavaScript is the foundation of SPAs, which provide seamless user experiences without page reloads.
* **Power Web APIs and Frameworks:** JavaScript is the driving force behind various web APIs and frameworks like jQuery, React, and Angular, providing powerful tools for web development.
