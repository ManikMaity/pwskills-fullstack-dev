## Primitive Data Types in JavaScript

In JavaScript, primitive data types represent fundamental values that cannot be broken down into smaller units of the same type. They serve as the building blocks for more complex data structures like arrays and objects. Notably, these primitive data types are immutable, meaning their values cannot be modified after creation.

### 1. Number:s

The number data type encompasses numeric values, including both integers (whole numbers) and decimals (fractions). Numbers can be positive, negative, or zero. Examples of number values include 10, -5.23, and 3.14159.

### 2. String: 

The string data type signifies a sequence of characters enclosed within single or double quotes. Strings are employed to store text, words, phrases, or any combination of characters. Examples of string values include "Hello, world!", 'This is a string', and "123 Main Street".

### 3. Boolean:

The boolean data type represents logical values, either true or false. Boolean values are often utilized to represent conditions or outcomes of comparisons. Examples of boolean values include true, false, and 1 (representing true) and 0 (representing false).

### 4. Undefined:

The undefined data type signifies a variable that has not yet been assigned a value. It also denotes the absence of a value when reading a property that does not exist. The undefined type is distinct from null, which explicitly represents the absence of a value.

### 5. Null:

The null data type explicitly represents the intentional absence of a value. It is used to clearly indicate that a variable or object does not hold any value. Unlike undefined, which is a default state, null is a deliberate assignment.
