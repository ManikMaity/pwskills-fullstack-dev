## Variable Declaration with the 'let' Keyword in JavaScript

In JavaScript, declaring variables is essential for organizing and managing data within a program. Variable declaration allows you to create named storage locations for values that can be used throughout your code. By declaring variables, you can improve code readability, maintainability, and overall program structure.

### Purpose of Variable Declaration

Variable declaration serves several key purposes:

1. **Data Initialization:** Variable declaration provides a way to initialize values for variables, ensuring that they have a defined value before being used.

2. **Memory Allocation:** When a variable is declared, memory is allocated to store the value associated with that variable. This enables the program to access and manipulate the data stored in the variable.

3. **Scope Definition:** Variable declaration establishes the scope of a variable, determining the regions of the code where the variable can be accessed and used.

### Declaring Variables Using the 'let' Keyword
