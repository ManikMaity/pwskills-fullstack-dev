## Importance of Meaningful Variable Names

1. **Enhanced Code Readability:** Descriptive variable names make code more self-explanatory, reducing the cognitive effort required to understand the purpose of each variable.

2. **Improved Code Maintainability:** Clear variable names simplify the process of modifying or updating code in the future, as the programmer's intent is readily apparent.

3. **Reduced Error Proneness:** Meaningful variable names minimize the likelihood of errors arising from misinterpreting variable meanings.

4. **Effective Collaboration:** Descriptive variable names promote better collaboration among team members, ensuring shared understanding and consistency in code style.

### Example of Clear Variable Names Improving Code Readability

Consider the following code snippets:

**Snippet 1:**

```javascript
let x = 10;
let y = 20;
let result = x + y;
console.log(result);
```

**Snippet 2:**

```javascript
let firstNumber = 10;
let secondNumber = 20;
let sum = firstNumber + secondNumber;
console.log(sum);
```
In Snippet 1, the variable names 'x' and 'y' lack context, making it unclear what values they represent. In contrast, Snippet 2 uses descriptive variable names 'firstNumber', 'secondNumber', and 'sum', which clearly convey the purpose of each variable.
