    <h1>z-index:</h1>
    <p>
        In web development, the z-index property is used to control the stacking
        order of elements on a web page. It determines which elements should
        appear in front of or behind other elements when they overlap in the web
        page's layout. Elements with a higher z-index value will be displayed on
        top of elements with a lower z-index value.
    </p>

    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>In this example, there are three div elements with the class "box," and each has a unique ID ("box1," "box2," and
        "box3"). Used the CSS position: absolute property to position these elements and the z-index property to
        control their stacking order. The boxes with higher z-index values will be displayed on top of boxes with
        lower z-index values. In this case, "Box 3" will be on top of "Box 2," and "Box 2" will be on top of "Box 1"
        because of the
        increasing z-index values.
    </p>

        <div class="box" id="box1">Box 1</div>
        <div class="box" id="box2">Box 2</div>
        <div class="box" id="box3">Box 3</div>
