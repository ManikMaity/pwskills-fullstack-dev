    <dl>
        <dt>HTML</dt>
        <dd>It is a programming language utilized for portraying the construction of data introduced on a page. Also, it
            utilizes the most recent rendition of HTML HTML5 which has new components and qualities for making web
            applications all the more effective and viably. The fundamental benefit that HTML5 is that it has sound and
            video support, which was excluded from past variants of HTML.</dd>
        <dt>CSS</dt>
        <dd>It is a template language that portrays the look and design of a document written in HTML. CSS is utilized

        <dt>Tailwind</dt>
        <dd>Tailwind CSS is basically a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. It is a
            highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build
            bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override.</dd>
        <dt>JavaScript</dt>
        <dd>It is the third primary technology for building the front end of a web application. It is regularly utilized
            for making dynamic and intuitive site pages. Besides, it also empowers basic and complex web animations,
            which significantly add to a positive client experience. JavaScript helps to make easy-to-understand
            applications for addition on this subject.</dd>
        <dt>React JS</dt>
        <dd>React.js is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It uses a component-based
            approach and a Virtual DOM to efficiently update web pages. React's declarative syntax and unidirectional
            data flow simplify UI development. It is widely used for creating web and mobile applications.</dd>
        <dt>Node JS</dt>
        <dd>Node.js is a runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server-side. It uses an
            event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it highly efficient and scalable. Node.js is commonly used for
            building server-side applications and APIs, and it has a rich ecosystem of packages available through npm
            (Node Package Manager).</dd>
        <dt>MongoDB</dt>
        <dd>MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, document-oriented format
            (JSON-like documents). It's designed for scalability, high availability, and fast data access, making it
            suitable for various applications. MongoDB is often used in modern web development for its ease of use and
            ability to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.</dd>
