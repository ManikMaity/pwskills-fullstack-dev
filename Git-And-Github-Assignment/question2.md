# Simple Git Workflow

## Working Directory:
This is where you make changes to your files.

## Staging Area:
A middle ground where changes are selected for the next commit using commands like `git add`.

## Repository:
The permanent storage for project history. Changes are committed here with `git commit`.

## Typical Workflow:
1. **Work on Files:** Make changes in the working directory.
2. **Stage Changes:** Use `git add` to prepare changes for commit.
3. **Commit Changes:** Use `git commit -m "Message"` to permanently save changes.
4. **Push Changes (Collaborative):** Upload committed changes with `git push`.
5. **Pull Changes (Collaborative):** Retrieve remote changes with `git pull`.
6. **Optional: Branching and Merging.**
