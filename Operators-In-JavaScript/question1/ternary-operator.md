# Ternary Operator in JavaScript

The ternary operator, also known as the conditional operator, is a concise way to write a simple `if-else` statement in a single line. It takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark (`?`), an expression to execute if the condition is true, and an expression to execute if the condition is false.

## Syntax

The syntax for the ternary operator is as follows:

```javascript
condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;
```
