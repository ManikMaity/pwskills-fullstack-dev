// Use a nested ternary operator to check that a number is positive, negative or zero. You have to print “positive” if the number is positive and similarly for negative and zero also. 


let number = -1;

(number > 0) ? console.log("Positive")
: (number == 0) ? console.log("Zero")
: console.log("Negative");

// Output - Negative
