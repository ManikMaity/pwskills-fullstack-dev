    <h2>Purpose of using var() function in css </h2>
    <p>The var() function in CSS, short for "variable," is used to define and apply custom properties, also known as CSS
        custom properties or CSS variables. These custom properties can store and reuse values throughout CSS
        stylesheet, making code more maintainable and flexible. The primary purposes of using the var() function in
        CSS are as follows:</p>

    <ul>
        <li> <strong>Consistency: </strong>We can define a CSS variable once and then use it throughout our stylesheet.
            This helps to ensure that CSS is consistent and easy to maintain.</li>
        <li><strong>Reusability: </strong>We can reuse CSS variables with different elements and selectors. This can
            save time and effort when writing CSS.</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic theming: </strong>We can use CSS variables to create dynamic themes that can be changed at
            runtime. This can be useful for creating websites and apps that can be customized by the user.</li>
    </ul>
