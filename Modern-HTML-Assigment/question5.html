      <h1>Features of HTML5 with explanations:</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h2>Video And Audio Tag:</h2>
          <p>
            One of the best feature of HTML5 is it have &lt;video&gt; and
            &lt;audio&gt; tags by which we can include videos or audios in the
            webpage.In HTML5, videos can be made to look nice with CSS, which
            changes how they appear. YouTube shares a code to put their videos
            on other websites, making the web more interesting with videos.
            Video tag support many video format including .mp4, .webm, .ogg .
            HTML audio tag is also very useful. By using audio tag we can
            include audio files to the website. Audio tag also support various
            audio format like .mp3, .ogg, .wav.
          </p>

        <li>
          <h2>Semantic Elements:</h2>
          <p>
            Semantic elements in HTML, such as &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, and
            &lt;footer&gt;, help organize and explain web content. They make
            websites more user-friendly for people who use screen readers and
            help websites rank better on search engines. These elements also
            make code easier to read and keep things looking the same on
            different web browsers. Since they work well on most browsers, they
            give users a consistent experience. Using semantic HTML is smart
            because it prepares websites for future changes in technology and
            follows the best way of creating user-friendly web content.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>JavaScript APIs:</h2>
          <p>
            HTML5 introduced JavaScript APIs that are very useful. These APIs
            offer powerful features like geolocation access, canvas graphics,
            local data storage, and real-time communication through WebSockets
            and WebRTC. They also streamline file handling, drag-and-drop
            interactions, and network requests with the Fetch API. These
            advancements have made it easier for developers to create
            interactive, responsive, and feature-rich web applications directly
            within the browser, reducing the reliance on external plugins and
            enhancing the overall user experience on the web.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Responsive Images:</h2>
          <p>
            HTML5 introduced "Responsive Images" to enhance web design. It
            allows developers to offer multiple image versions for different
            screen sizes using the "srcset" attribute. The "sizes" attribute
            helps browsers decide which image to display based on device
            parameters, like screen size and pixel density. This dynamic
            selection ensures images look sharp and load quickly, optimizing the
            user experience. Responsive Images are a vital component of modern
            web development, ensuring websites appear polished and perform well
            across a variety of devices and screen sizes.
